## A small Kotlin app with a JMH benchmark, built with the Gradle Kotlin DSL

All the examples I could find were setup so that the benchmark code was
in the main sources and run as the main application, or small `example`
subprojects inside bigger repositories.

My first attempts at making this work was baking my own gradle tasks for
running `jmh`, but I found getting the code generation and the annotation
processor to play ball pretty finnicky. Luckily the [jmh-gradle-plugin]
handles all of this! It also neatly expects the code outside of `main`.

### Testing

```shell
$ ./gradlew test
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 4s
5 actionable tasks: 5 executed
```

```shell
$ ./gradlew smoke
> Task :app:smoke
ðŸ’ƒ calculating...distance: 4

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
2 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 1 up-to-date
```

### Benchmarking

```shell
$ ./gradlew jmh

> Task :app:jmhRunBytecodeGenerator
[ ... ]
Writing out Java source to ~/code/kotlin-gradle-jmh/app/build/jmh-generated-sources and resources to ~/code/kotlin-gradle-jmh/app/build/jmh-generated-resources

> Task :app:jmh
# JMH version: 1.30
# VM version: JDK 15.0.2, OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, 15.0.2+7-27
[ ... ]
Do not assume the numbers tell you what you want them to tell.
