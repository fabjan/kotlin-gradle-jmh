## A small Kotlin app with a JMH benchmark, built with the Gradle Kotlin DSL

All the examples I could find were setup so the benchmark code was in the main sources and run as the main application. 

### Testing

```shell
$ ./gradlew test
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 4s
5 actionable tasks: 5 executed
```

```shell
$ ./gradlew smoke
> Task :app:smoke
ðŸ’ƒ calculating...distance: 4

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
2 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 1 up-to-date
```
